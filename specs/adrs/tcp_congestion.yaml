# TCP Congestion Control Algorithm
# ADRS problem: maximize throughput while minimizing latency and maintaining fairness.
problem:
  name: tcp_congestion_control
  type: optimization
  language: python
  category: adrs

objective:
  maximize: throughput_latency_ratio
  description: >
    Composite metric: throughput / (latency * jitter_penalty).
    Higher is better. Measures network utilization efficiency.

constraints:
  - name: buffer_bounds
    description: >
      Send window and receive buffer never exceed configured maximum.
    hard: true
  - name: fairness
    description: >
      Jain's fairness index across competing flows must be >= 0.9.
      No single flow dominates bandwidth.
    hard: true
  - name: no_congestion_collapse
    description: >
      Total throughput must not drop below 50% of link capacity
      under sustained load.
    hard: true
  - name: convergence
    description: >
      Algorithm must reach steady-state within 100 RTTs of startup.
    hard: false

parameters:
  num_flows: [2, 5, 10, 50]
  link_capacity_mbps: [10, 100, 1000]

  loss_rate: [0.001, 0.01, 0.05]
  buffer_size_packets: [50, 200, 1000]

scoring:
