# Cloud Batch Scheduling (CBL)
# ADRS problem: minimize cost of running batch jobs with SLA deadlines.
problem:
  name: cloud_batch_scheduling
  type: optimization
  language: python
  category: adrs

objective:
  minimize: total_cost
  description: >
    Total dollar cost of compute resources used. Includes on-demand,
    spot, and reserved instance pricing. Lower is better.

constraints:
  - name: sla_deadlines
    description: >
      Every job must complete before its deadline. Deadline violations
      incur a large penalty (10x job cost).
    hard: true
  - name: spot_availability
    description: >
      Spot instances may be preempted. Algorithm must handle preemption
      by rescheduling on alternative resources.
    hard: true
  - name: resource_limits
    description: >
      Total instances of each type cannot exceed account limits.
    hard: true
  - name: data_locality
    description: >
      Prefer scheduling jobs near their data. Cross-region transfer
      adds latency and cost.
    hard: false

parameters:
  num_jobs: [50, 200, 1000]
  num_instance_types: [5, 10, 20]
  num_regions: [3, 5]
  spot_preemption_rate: [0.05, 0.15, 0.30]
  deadline_tightness: [0.5, 1.0, 2.0]  # relative to min completion time

scoring:
  normalization: all_on_demand_cost
